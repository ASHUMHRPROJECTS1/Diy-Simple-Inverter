An inverter that uses the minimum number of components for converting a 12 V DC to 220 V AC is called a simple

inverter. A 12 V lead-acid battery is the most standard form of battery that is used for operating such inverters.

By following this guide, you will be able to know and make your Simple DIY Inverter. This project guide

contains the ꢀles necessary to help you step by step produce your own Simple DIY Inverter. Please follow

the steps of the project to get a positive result.

**Disclaimer:** Be extra careful with this project as it produces a High Voltage - High Current output.

**Step 1: Get your PCB ready!**

**Talking About Electronics**

After making the circuit diagram I transformed it into a PCB design to produce it, to produce the PCB, I

have chosen [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)[ ](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)the best PCB supplier and the cheapest PCB provider to order my circuit. with the

reliable platform, all I need to do is some simple clicks to upload the Gerber ꢀle and set some parameters

like the PCB thickness color and quantity. I’ve paid just 2 Dollars to get my PCB after ꢀve days only, what I

have noticed about [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)[ ](https://jlcpcb.com/IAT)this time is the "out-of-charge **PCB color**" which means you will pay only 2

USD for any PCB color you choose.

**Related Download Files**

As you can see in the pictures above the PCB is very well manufactured and I’ve got the same PCB design

that we’ve made for our main board and all the labels and logos are there to guide me during the

soldering steps. You can also download the Gerber ꢀle for this circuit from the download link below in

case you want to place an order for the same circuit design.
