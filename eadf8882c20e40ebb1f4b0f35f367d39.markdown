> **Diy Simple Inverter**
> by Ashu Mhr Projects

An inverter that uses the minimum number of components for converting a
12 V DC to 220 V AC is called a simple inverter. A 12 V lead-acid
battery is the most standard form of battery that is used for operating
such inverters.

transformer to switch and the other wire to the left side of the female
socket as shown below.
