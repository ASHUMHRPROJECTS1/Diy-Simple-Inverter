An inverter that uses the minimum number of components for converting a 12 V DC to 220 V AC is called a simple inverter. A
12 V lead-acid battery is the most standard form of battery that is used for operating such inverters.
**Supplies:**

1×Pvc Sheet
1×5pin plug socket

Simple DIY Inverter
An inverter that uses the minimum number of components for converting a 12 V DC to 220 V AC is called a simple
inverter. A 12 V lead-acid battery is the most standard form of battery that is used for operating such inverters.
By following this guide, you will be able to know and make your Simple DIY Inverter. This project guide
contains the 9les necessary to help you step by step produce your own Simple DIY Inverter. Please follow
the steps of the project to get a positive result.

**Disclaimer:Disclaimer:** Be extra careful with this project as it produces a High Voltage - High Current output.

After making the circuit diagram I transformed it into a PCB design to produce it, to produce the PCB, I
have chosen JLCPCB the best PCB supplier and the cheapest PCB provider to order my circuit. with the
reliable platform, all I need to do is some simple clicks to upload the Gerber 9le and set some parameters
like the PCB thickness color and quantity. I’ve paid just 2 Dollars to get my PCB after 9ve days only, what I
have noticed about JLCPCB this time is the "out-of-charge **PCB color PCB color** " which means you will pay only 2
USD for any PCB color you choose.

As you can see in the pictures above the PCB is very well manufactured and I’ve got the same PCB design
that we’ve made for our main board and all the labels and logos are there to guide me during the
soldering steps. You can also download the Gerber 9le for this circuit from the download link below in


case you want to place an order for the same circuit design.



## Step 2: Get All the Components Listed Below Images









## Step 3: Place All the Components on PCB and Solder It Properly

Place All The Components On PCB, do all the connection carefully and Solder It Properly





## Step 4: )

After soldering all the components to PCB, connect one input wire of the transformer to switch and the other wire to the left
side of the female socket as shown below.
Then connect the audio socket to the PVC Sheet, solder black wire of PCB to Black audio-video socket.
Solder the red wire of PCB to an SPST Switch, solder a wire to another point of same SPST switch, then solder it
to the red audio-video socket






## Step 5: )

```
Solder 5mm yellow LED with 1k resistor to the positive and negative leg of Audio/Video jack.
Connect 7805 voltage regulator ic with cooling fan and do all other connection of cooling fan and 7805 ic to
```

audio/video jack and SPST switch as shown in below images.






## Step 6: )

```
Connect the Green Positive wire of RED led with 1k resistor to the SPST switch as shown below, connect the
yellow negative wire of red led to the negative terminal of audio/video socket.
And BOOM! All the connections are done, it's time to cover the body with another PVC sheet.
```



## Step 7: )

Connect the 12V Lead Acid Battery to the inverter, & your Inverter is now Ready to power up your Small Ac appliances.
